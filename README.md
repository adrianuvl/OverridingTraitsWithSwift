OverridingTraitsWithSwift
=========================

Master-detail app using Swift in iOS8 to override the UITraitCollection (uses setOverrideTraitCollection)

Demonstates how to override the traits such that an iPhone Master-detail view in landscape mode shows both master and detail on the same screen.

Based loosely on WWDC14 example in 216 Building Adaptive Apps with UIKit
